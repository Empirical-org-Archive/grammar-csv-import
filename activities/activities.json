The rocket  they were using was a new type called a Voskhod{+rocket, that-rocket, which|313}  had an inflatable airlock built-in.<br/><br/>The {+airlock, which-airlock, that|285}  Soviet scientists had only completed nine months prior, functioned perfectly during  the mission. {+However,-However|462} the {+cosmonauts'-cosmonauts|502} suits did  not work {+quite-quiet|223} as well.

Despite the danger of the maneuver, Leonov managed  to release enough pressure {+that-where|313} he was able to safely re-enter the  rocket.  <br/><br/>Once Leonov was back inside the craft, the two cosmonauts {+then-than|272}  worked {+quickly-quick|431} to prepare their ship to return to earth. What the men  did not anticipate was how difficult it would be to maneuver {+themselves-himself|481}  inside the rocket while wearing {+their-there|274} bulky spacesuits. As a result,  they took an additional 46 seconds to get the {+ship's-ships|499} center of gravity  into the correct position to re-enter earth's atmosphere. The delay caused the ship  to fly off course, and the two men landed in the inhospitable Soviet tundra.<br/><br/>When  the craft landed, the forest cover was so dense that the {+Soviets-Soviet's|501}  could not land helicopters in the area. The two cosmonauts had to spend the night  out in the forest in -45C weather. The next morning, the two {+cosmonauts-Cosmonauts|409}  awoke to a Soviet search and rescue squad, who transported them back to base. Despite  the problems that arose during the mission, as well as the risky solutions the men  were forced to employ, both Leonov and Belyayev survived the ordeal.

Every year the mayor and volunteers from the community carve over 3,000 pumpkins  for the visitors who attend Autumnfest weekend festivities. The {+city’s-city’s  / cities|499} name is derived from {+Kenova's-Kenova’s’ / Kenova|499} three bordering  states: Kentucky, Ohio, and West Virginia. <br/>  <br/>Kenova was also home to the  recently demolished Ceredo-Kenova High School, winner of 12 {+state-state / State|411}  football championships. Ceredo-Kenova High School graduated several well-known {+athletes,-athlete’s,  / athletes,|501} musicians, and entrepreneurs: Pittsburg Pirate baseball player,  Donny Robinson, Grammy Award winning Christian musician, Michael W. Smith, and CEO  of Intuit, Brad Smith, to name just a few. <br/>  <br/>In 1970 Kenova made national  headlines when a plane carrying the Marshall {+University-university / University|411}  football team, {+coaches-coach’s, / coaches,|501} and community leaders crashed  into a hillside while approaching Tri-State Airport, located near the city limits.  The movie \"We Are Marshall,\" starring Matthew McConaughey, is based on the story  of how the University overcame the tragedy and rebuilt the football program where  {+-(notables / notable’s)|228} Chad Pennington, Byron Leftwich, and Randy Moss played.  Several scenes from the movie were actually filmed in Kenova.",

      "passage": "On July 16th, 1969, hundreds of people traveled to the Kennedy Space Center in  Florida to watch the Launch of the Apollo 11 rocket. Speakers announced, “You {+may-can  / may|119} not approach the launch site without permission.” Nine and a half years  ago, President John F. Kennedy promised we would land a man on the Moon in the next  10 years. Today was the last chance America had to keep its promise. NASA knew they  {+must-must / should|120} launch the rocket now, or they would run out of time.  The crew asked Mission Control if they {+may-may / can|119} begin the countdown  to launch. It was a perfect day for flying, so NASA knew there {+should-should  / must|120} not be any problems.<br/><br/>After a rocket leaves Earth, there is nothing  else Mission Control {+can-may / can|119} do, so the launch is always tense. Once  the rocket was close to the Moon, Mission Control told the crew they {+must-must  / should|120} circle the moon once, because that was the only way to slow down.  NASA suggested that they {+should-should / must|120} try to find some good rocks  to bring back.<br/><br/>Two of the crew members, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, launched  a smaller ship from the Apollo 11 rocket, and landed on the Moon. When Neil Armstrong  first stepped out of the ship he said, “That's one small step for a man, and one  giant leap for mankind.”",

They went  about their lives by surviving off of the land, following strict social rules, and  {+respecting-respected|251} their aumakuas, or \"family gods.\" Unlike more powerful  deities, such as Pele, the fiery goddess of volcanoes, aumakuas interacted specifically  with individual families as spiritual guides. They were known for appearing in peoples'  dreams, {+save-saving|252} people from harm, and bringing about good fortune to  people in need.<br/><br/>Like the spirit guides of other religions, aumakuas were  said to be able to shape-shift. They could appear as a shark lurking on the ocean  floor, or a hawk circling the skies. However, they were said to make themselves  known easily to anyone who worshipped them. Out of respect for these spirit guides,  the Hawaiian people payed tribute to them, asked for their guidance, and {+considered-consider|249}  them to be family.",
