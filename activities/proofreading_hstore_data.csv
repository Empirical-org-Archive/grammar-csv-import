","--- ""The English word pirate is derived from the Greek word πειρατής (peirates), which
  meant a robber, especially a robber at sea. In ancient times, pirates sailed the
  Mediterranean, and many stories were told about those pirates. There is a famous
  legend about the god Dionysus and some pirates, for example, and there is also a
  famous story about Alexander the Great and a pirate named Diomedes.\r\n\r\nDiomedes,
  so the story tells us, was a notorious pirate who had finally been captured and
  brought before the emperor for sentencing. Because of the pirate's many criminal
  deeds, everyone expected that Alexander would sentence the pirate to death and {+cleanse-cleans|204}
  the seas of his evil.  Before he passed judgment, however, Alexander decided to
  interview the pirate.\r\n\r\n{+\""Although-\""All though|199} I am inclined to be
  done with you, I must ask, what could possibly give you the right to sail the seas,
  marauding merchants and taking {+their-there|212} goods?\"" Alexander asked the pirate.\r\n\r\nDiomedes
  boldly replied with some questions of his own. \""O Emperor,\"" he said, \""what could
  possibly give you the right to travel the whole world, taking by force things that
  do not belong to you? What gave you the right to occupy the land of Egypt? Who made
  you king of Persia? {+Finally,-Finely,|201} by what authority did you invade the
  land of India?\r\n\r\nAlexander sat on this {+throne-thrown|197} and stared at the
  man in amazement. Diomedes went on speaking. \""Because I use only my own boat,\""
  he said, \""I am called a pirate. You, however, use your army and your navy, and
  so you are proclaimed an emperor. If you ask me who is the greater criminal, I cannot
  say. I do know, however, that if I had such weapons at my disposal, I would be an
  emperor {+too.\""-two.\""|210}\r\n\r\nAlexander was so impressed by this reply that
  instead of punishing the pirate, he let him go, praising him for his boldness and
  insight. It was a rare thing to meet a man who said what he {+meant.-mint.|198}""
