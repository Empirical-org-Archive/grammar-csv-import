  Leonov noticed his suit had became so swollen that he was unable to reach the lock

  rocket.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOnce Leonov was back inside the craft, the two cosmonauts {+then-than|207}

  did not anticipate was how difficult it would be to maneuver {+themselves-himself|69}
  inside the rocket while wearing {+their-there|212} bulky spacesuits. As a result,
  they took an additional 46 seconds to get the {+ship's-ships|165} center of gravity
  into the correct position to re-enter earth's atmosphere. The delay caused the ship
  to fly off course, and the two men landed in the inhospitable Soviet tundra.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen
  the craft landed, the forest cover was so dense that the {+Soviets-Soviet's|228}

  meant a robber, especially a robber at sea. In ancient times, pirates sailed the

  famous story about Alexander the Great and a pirate named Diomedes.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiomedes,

  brought before the emperor for sentencing. Because of the pirate's many criminal

  boldly replied with some questions of his own. \\\""O Emperor,\\\"" he said, \\\""what could
